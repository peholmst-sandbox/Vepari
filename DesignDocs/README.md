# Design Documents

This directory contains different design documents used during the design and development of Vepari. I keep them as a record of different ideas I've had, design decisions I have made, etc. I don't keep them up-to-date unless there is a good reason to do so.

* [Project Vision](ProjectVision.md): Overview of what this system is all about and what purpose it serves.
* [Hardware and Platforms](HardwareAndPlatforms.md): The platform and hardware that the system will be built on and why they were chosen.
* [UI Sketches](UserInterfaceSketches.md): Some very rough sketches of what the UI of the different applications could look like (in terms of content, not visual appearance).

Coming:

* Architecture Design: the architecture of the system.
